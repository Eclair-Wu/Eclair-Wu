# learning-journey

As a tiro in theoretical chemistry, I hope to use this repository to record my learning journey.  
Now include HF/RHF/UHF/CIS/FCI/CASCI/PBC-HF using intergals in Pyscf and a simple NVE/NVT MD by myself.  
(PBC-HF follows Qiming's tutorial)  
Futher plan: TDHF/CCSD/MP2/X2C/EOMCC.
